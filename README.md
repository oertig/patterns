# Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are not a specific piece of code, but a concept you need to adapt. They consist of groups of typical solutions to commonly occuring problems.

## Types of Design Patterns

| Supertype  | Explanation                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Creational | How objects are created                 |
| Structural | How objects relate to each other        |
| Behavioral | How objects communicate with each other |
